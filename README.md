## Introduction

In the field of machine learning, understanding the inner workings of algorithms is essential for building a strong foundation. By implementing algorithms from scratch, you gain insights into the mathematical principles that drive these methods and learn how to optimize and fine-tune them. This repository is designed to provide you with hands-on experience in building machine learning algorithms without relying on external libraries.

## Algorithms

The repository is amied to cover all the basic machine learning algorithms, including but not limited to:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Gradient Boosting

Each algorithm will have its own directory within the repository, containing the implementation code, necessary datasets (if applicable), and a README explaining the algorithm's theory and usage.

## Getting Started

To get started with using this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

2. **Navigate to Algorithm Directory:** Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the specific algorithm directory you're interested in. Each algorithm will have its own separate directory with a self-explanatory name.

3. **Explore the Code and Documentation:** Inside the algorithm directory, you'll find the implementation code and a README file. The README file will provide you with an overview of the algorithm, its mathematical foundation, and instructions on how to run the code.

4. **Run the Code:** Follow the instructions in the README file to run the algorithm's implementation. You can experiment with different parameters, datasets, and settings to deepen your understanding.
